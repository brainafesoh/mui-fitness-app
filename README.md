# Intro Tutorial react with Material-UI

This project is a result of [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/meet-your-material-ui-your-new-favorite-user-interface-library-6349a1c88a8c) intro tutorial whose objective was to build a simple fitness app(out of boredom building to-do intro apps).

The main objective behind was to learn how to use [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) which is an implementation of [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/design/) for the React js library.

Run **npm install** to install all dependencies then **npm start** to run and visualize the app in your browser.

## Future work ideas

* Reorganise and refactor the code to make it more comprehensible.
* Making the data persistant. Maybe linking the app to a real database where we could store and retreive the list of exercises. So a _backend(somehow)_
* Add _TDD_ maybe!!?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Check the link to know more.
